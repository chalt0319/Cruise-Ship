With this app, you can create an account for your cruise, add excursions (and delete them), and see how much time you will be spending on all your excursions.

## Usage

To use this app, just clone, run `rake db:migrate`, `rake db:seed` and then run `thin start --ssl`. Everything should be set up from there.
